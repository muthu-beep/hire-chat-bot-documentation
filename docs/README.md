## HirBot

> A magical voicebot that cuts down your interview process

## What it is

dHirbot is an integration of Dialogflow, Google Sheets and Twillio to make a simple IVR system that can call people who apply and have a personalised/tailored experience at no expensive human cost. We can also use Firebase as an intermediate step to make the entire process more streamlined. To deploy and use this yourself, use this documentation and this [Github Repo](deploy.md).

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.

## Features

- No statically built js files
- The entire platform is built on the roboust Python-3.7 Platform
- Witty small talk by Dialogflow
- Skype/Twillio Integration
- Uses Forms and Sheets API

- Can support further integration of SendGrid and other communication platforms
- Open Source Code ([example](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-ssr-demo))
